## Definitions 👩🏻‍🏫

**Recursion**: is a technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. A recursive function typically solves a problem by reducing it to a smaller instance of the same problem, which is solved in the same way, until it reaches a base case.

**Photosynthesis**: is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy stored in molecules such as glucose. This process is fundamental to life on Earth as it is the primary source of organic matter for almost all organisms and releases oxygen into the atmosphere as a byproduct.

**Term**: Definition of the term.

## Important Code snippets 🧮

**For loop**: Iterates over a sequence, such as a list or a range of numbers. 

    for item in items:
        print(item)

**SELECT**: A statement in SQL is used to query data from a database.
    
    SELECT name FROM people;

**Bubble sort**: a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the list is sorted.

    def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)

    # Traverse through all elements in the array
    for i in range(n):

        # Track if a swap was made in this pass
        swapped = False
        
        # Last i elements are already sorted, so we can skip them
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):

            # Compare adjacent elements
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:

                # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
                swapped = True
        
        # If no elements were swapped, the array is already sorted
        if not swapped:
            break

    # Example usage
    arr = [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]
    bubble_sort(arr)
    print("Sorted array:", arr)

## Step-by-step examples 😇

### Printing dog in Python
**1. Define the Function** Use the def keyword to define a function. Name the function then add a parameter to the function to specify how many times to print "dog".

    def print_dog(n):


**2. Implement a Loop** Use a for loop to repeat the printing process.

    def print_dog(n):
        for i in range(n):
            print("dog")

**3. Call the function**: Call the function with a specific number to see the output.

    print_dog(5)

## Questions & Discussions 🙋🏼

**What is the derivative of the function \\(f(x) = 3x^4 - 5x^2 + 2x - 7\\)?**
To find the derivative of the function \\(f(x) = 3x^4 - 5x^2 + 2x - 7\\), we will use the power rule, which states that the derivative of \\(x^n\\) is \\(nx^{n-1}\\$. 

Now let's differentiate each term:

1. The derivative of \\(3x^4\\) is \\(12x^3\\) (using the power rule: \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) and decrease the exponent by 1).
2. The derivative of \\(-5x^2\\) is \\(-10x\\) (again, using the power rule: \\(2 \\times -5 = -10\\)).
3. The derivative of \\(2x\\) is \\(2\\) (the derivative of \\(x\\) is \\(1\\), so \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\)).
4. The derivative of a constant \\(-7\\) is \\(0\\).

Putting it all together, the derivative \\(f'(x)\\) is:
\\[
f'(x) = 12x^3 - 10x + 2
\\]

So the final answer is \\(f'(x) = 12x^3 - 10x + 2\\).
